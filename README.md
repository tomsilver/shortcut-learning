# Shortcut Learning

![workflow](https://github.com/tomsilver/shortcut-learning/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Ongoing research in shortcut learning.

## Installation

Requirements: Python >=3.10 and <=3.12.

We strongly recommend [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). The steps below assume that you have `uv` installed. If you do not, just remove `uv` from the commands and the installation should still work.

```
uv pip install -e ".[develop]"
```

Check the installation: ```./run_ci_checks.sh```
